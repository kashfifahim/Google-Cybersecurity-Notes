principle of least privilege is the concept of granting only the minimal access and authorization required to complete a task
users should not have privileges that are beyond what is necessary

chmod command can help you manage this authorization
chmod command changes permissions on files and directories
chmod requires two arguments
the first argument indicates how to change permissions
the second argument indicates the file or directory that you want to change permissions for

chmod u+rwx, g+rwx, o+rwx login_sessions.txt

chmod u-rwx, g-rwx, o-rwx login_sessions.txt

chmod u=r, g=r, o=r login_sessons.txt
this command overwrites existing permissions
