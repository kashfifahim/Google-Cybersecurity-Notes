sudo allows users to have elevated permissions without risking the system by running commands as the root suer

to manage authorization and authentication you need to be a root user
or a user with elevated privileges to modify the system

you become a root user by logging in as the root user
running commands as the root user is not recommended in linux because it can cause security risks
rather than loggin in as the root user, it's recommended you use sudo in linux when you need elevated privileges

sudo command temporarily grants elevated permissions to specific users
users must be given access in a configuration file called the sudoers file to use sudo
important to be aware that users with elevated permissions to use sudo might be more at risk in the event of an attack

authentication is the process of verifying who someone is
authorization is the concept of granting access to specific resources in a system
