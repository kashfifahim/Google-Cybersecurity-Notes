a regular expression (regex) is a sequence of characters that forms a pattern
to access regular expressions and related functions in python you need to import
import re 

regular expressions are stored in python as strings 
then these strings are used in re module functions to search through other strings 

re.findall() function returns a list of matches to a regular expression.
re.findall() requries two parameters.
the first parameter is the string containing the regular expression pattern 
the second parameter is the string you want to search through 

import re 
re.findall("ts", "tsnow, tsha, bmoreno")

if you want to do more than search for specific strings you must incorporate special symbols into your regular expressions 

\w matches with any alphanumeric character 
. matches to all characters including symbols 
\d matches to all single digits [0-9]
\s matches to all single spaces
\. matches to the period character 
+ sum
