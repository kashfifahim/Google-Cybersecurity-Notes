a virtual machine is a virtual version of a physical computer
virtualization is the process of using software to create virtual representation of various physical machines
virtual machine has a virtual cpu, virtual storage, and other virtual hardware
virtual systems are just code

virtualization provides an isolated environment, or a sandbox, on the physical host machine
virtual machines can be kept separate from the other systems
a security professional can intentionally place malware on a virtual machine to examine it in a more secure environment

a malicious program can escape virtualization and access the host machine
you should never completely trust virtualized systems

virtual machines can be managed with a software called a hypervisor
hypervisors help users manage multiple virtual machines and connect the virtual and physical hardware

kernel-based virtual machine is an open source hypervisor that is supported by most major linux distributions
kvm is built into the linux kernel
kmv can be used to create virtual machines on any machine running a linux operating system
