use joins to join data from multiple tables when these tables share a common column 

inner join returns 
rows matching on a specified column that exists in more than one table 
inner join only returns the rows where there is a match and it returns all specified columns from all joined tables 

if a column exists in both of the tables it is returned twice when SELECT * is used 

SELECT *
FROM employees 
INNER JOIN machines ON employees.device_id =  machines.device_id;

you must specify the two tables to join by including the first or left table after FROM 
and the second or right table after INNER JOIN 
after the name of the right table use the ON keyword and the = operator to indicate the column you are joining the tables on. 
It is important that you specify both the table and column names in this portion of the join by placing a period (.) between the table and the column. 

Outer joins returns all rows from either one table or both tables

when joining two tables 
LEFT JOIN returns all the records of the first table 
but only returns rows of the second table that match on a specified column 

SELECT *
FROM employees 
LEFT JOIN machines ON employees.device_id = machines.device_id;

First specify the first or left table that comes after FROM 
The second or right table as the table that comes after LEFT JOIN 

when joining two tables 
right join returns all of the records of the second table 
but only returns rows from the first table that match on a specified column

SELECT *
FROM employees 
RIGHT JOIN machines ON employees.device_id = machines.device_id;

RIGHT JOIN has the same syntax as LEFT JOIN with the only difference being the keyword RIGHT JOIN instructs SQL to produce different output.
The query returns all records from machines which is the second or right table. 

FULL OUTER JOIN returns all records from both tables. Think of it as a way of completely merging two tables.

SELECT *
FROM employees
FULL OUTER JOIN machines ON employees.device_id = machines.device_id;

FULL OUTER JOIN query include all records from both tables.
Similar to INNER JOIN the order of the tables does not change the results of the query
