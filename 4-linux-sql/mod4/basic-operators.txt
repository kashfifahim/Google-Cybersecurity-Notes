to create a filter in sql you need to use the where keyword 
where indicates the condition for a filter 
you can also filter based on a pattern 

filtering for a pattern requires incorporating two more elements into your where cluase: a wildcard and the like operator 

a wildcard is a special character that can be substituted with any other character 
two useful wildcards are the % and the _

% substitutes for any number of other characters 
_ substitutes only for one other character 

to apply wildcards to the filter you need to use the like operator instead of the equal sign = 
like is used with where to search for a pattern in a column
