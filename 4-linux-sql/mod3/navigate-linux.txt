a file path is the location of a file or directory
in the file path the different levels of a hierarchy are separated by a forward slash

the root directory is the highest-level directory in linux
the root directory is always represented with a forward slash / 
all subdirectories branch off the root directory
subdirectories can continue branching out to as many levels as necessary

/home, each user in the system gets their own home directory
/bin, stands for binary and contains binary files and other executables 
/etc, stores the system's configuration files
/tmp, stores many temporary files
/mnt, stands for mount and stores media such as usb drives and hard drives

executables are files that contain a series of commands a computer needs to follow to run programs and perform other functions
the /tmp directory is commonly used by attackers because anyone in teh system can modify data in these files

you can navigate to specific subdirectories using their absolute or relative paths
the absolute file path is the full file path that starts from the root
relative file path is the file path that starts from a user's current directory

relative file paths can use a dot . to represent the current directory
relative file paths can use two dots .. to represent the parent or the current directory

pwd command pritns the working directory to the screen
whoami returns the username of the current user
ls command displays the names of the files and directories in the current working directory
cd command navigates between directories
you can use the relative file path and eter cd .. to go up one level

cat command displays the contents of a file
head command displays the first 10 lines of a file
tail command displays the last 10 lines of a file
use tail to read the most recent information in a log file

less command returns the content of a file one page at a time
space bar moves forward one page
b moves back one page
down arrow move forward one line
up arrow move back one line
q quit and return to the previous line
